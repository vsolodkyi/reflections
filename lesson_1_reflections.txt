How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I can idenify many mechanical mistakes and errors

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    We can mention when programs was changed and by whom it was changed. If the next version was full of bugs or we violated the law or our third party tools changed critically wrong we can easily return to any of early version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Programmer can structured his/her commits in logical manner and write comments on it. When GD changes, a human can't often can't explain what changed and why it was changed.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It's a big advanages that programmer can save files in one working repository, other systems can't garantee balanced changes and working repository.  

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Command 'Git log' shows aggregate information (id commit, comments) in all changes; Command 'git diff' shows details between two commits. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can be assured that nobody can damage critically our reports and efforts.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to change any file and see who changed file and who did it.
